# JavaScript-Name-List

This project was a simple assignment for an internship where I was asked to show my skill in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I decided to 
include JQuery and Bootstrap to make the application a little bit better. Simply put, this application takes the name and age of a person 
in the fields and then adds them to a list below the form. Then the user can click "Clear" to clear the list.
